# Random-Name-Generator

To be more specific- this random name generator uses two csv files who have both the top 2021 male and female baby names.

The purpose of this project was to try out my first GUI application and using the pandas library. I wanted to see the potential of stuff I can achieve withe the two. This is a simple version I made with a lot of potential to create more user friendly and include more functions to increase its productiveness. 

This was made in Python with the Pandas and Tkinter libraries.

Main features at the moment are to generate a random male or female name by clicking the one of the two buttons. Potentially I will broaden out this application in the future or just use this as a stepping stone to make something better later on.

You'll be able to run this code if you have the pandas and tkinter libraries installed as well as an IDE or text editor. 
You can pip install the two libraries if you do not have them.

(clicking the button will generate a new random name from the csv file.)
